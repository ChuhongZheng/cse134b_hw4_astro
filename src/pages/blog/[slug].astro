				<p>Astro is a modern static site builder that delivers lightning-fast performance with a JavaScript-first approach. Unlike traditional frameworks that ship your entire application to the client, Astro only ships the parts that are absolutely necessary.</p>
				
				<h2>Why Choose Astro?</h2>
				
				<p>Astro offers several key advantages:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><strong>Zero JavaScript by default:</strong> Only load JavaScript when you actually need it</li>
					<li><strong>Bring Your Own Framework:</strong> Use React, Vue, Svelte, or any other UI framework</li>
					<li><strong>Island Architecture:</strong> Send only interactive components to the client</li>
					<li><strong>Great Performance:</strong> Built-in optimizations for fast loading</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Creating Your First Astro Project</h2>
				
				<p>To get started with Astro, you'll need Node.js installed. Then run:</p>
				
				<pre><code>npm create astro@latest my-blog
cd my-blog
npm run dev</code></pre>
				
				<p>This will scaffold a new Astro project and start the development server. You can now begin building your static site!</p>

				<p>Astro's island architecture is a revolutionary approach to building web applications. Instead of shipping a whole page of JavaScript to the client, Astro sends only the interactive components (the "islands") that need JavaScript.</p>
				
				<h2>How Islands Work</h2>
				
				<p>In traditional frameworks like Next.js or Nuxt, the entire page is hydrated with JavaScript. With Astro, only components that have interactivity are sent to the browser:</p>
				
				<pre><code>// This component will be interactive in the browser
---
import MyInteractiveComponent from '../components/MyInteractiveComponent.astro';
---

<!-- Static HTML -->
<h1>Welcome to my site</h1>
<p>This content is static and requires zero JavaScript</p>

<!-- Interactive "island" -->
<MyInteractiveComponent client:load /></code></pre>
				
				<h2>Benefits of Island Architecture</h2>
				
				<ol>
					<li><strong>Faster Initial Load:</strong> Less JavaScript to parse and execute</li>
					<li><strong>Better Performance:</strong> Reduced bundle sizes mean faster interactions</li>
					<li><strong>Improved SEO:</strong> Content is immediately available to search engines</li>
					<li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Faster time-to-content for visitors</li>
				</ol>

				<p>Astro is perfect for building blogs thanks to its excellent Markdown support and static site generation capabilities. In this guide, we'll walk through creating a performant blog with Astro.</p>
				
				<h2>Setting Up Markdown Support</h2>
				
				<p>Astro has built-in support for Markdown pages. Simply create a file with the .md extension in your src/pages directory:</p>

# My First Blog Post

Today we're learning how to build a blog with Astro!</code></pre>
				
				<h2>Creating Layout Components</h2>
				
				<p>For consistent styling across your blog, create reusable layout components:</p>
				
				<pre><code><!-- src/layouts/BlogLayout.astro -->
---
import BaseLayout from './BaseLayout.astro';
---

<BaseLayout>
	<header>
		<h1>My Astro Blog</h1>
	</header>
	<main>
		<slot /> <!-- Page content goes here -->
	</main>
</BaseLayout></code></pre>
				
				<p>This modular approach makes it easy to maintain consistency throughout your site.</p>

			date: "Mar 5, 2025",
			content: `
				<p>While Astro is fast by default, there are several techniques you can use to optimize your site even further.</p>
				
				<h2>Image Optimization</h2>
				
				<p>Use Astro's built-in Image component for automatic optimization:</p>
				
				<pre><code>---
import { Image } from 'astro:assets';
import heroImage from '../assets/hero.jpg';
---

<Image src={heroImage} alt="Hero image" width={800} height={450} /></code></pre>
				
				<h2>Smart Component Hydration</h2>
				
				<p>Choose the right hydration strategy for your components:</p>
				
				<ul>
					<li><code>client:load</code> - Load immediately</li>
					<li><code>client:idle</code> - Load when browser is idle</li>
					<li><code>client:visible</code> - Load when scrolled into view</li>
					<li><code>client:media</code> - Load based on media query</li>
				</ul>
				
				<h2>Code Splitting</h2>
				
				<p>Astro automatically splits your code for optimal delivery. Each page is compiled independently, ensuring users only download what they need.</p>

		"using-view-transitions-in-astro": {
			title: "Using View Transitions in Astro",
			date: "Mar 18, 2025",
			content: `
				<p>View Transitions is a new browser API that enables smooth transitions between pages. Astro has built-in support for this feature.</p>
				
				<h2>Enabling View Transitions</h2>
				
				<p>Add the view-transitions integration to your Astro config:</p>
				
				<pre><code>// astro.config.mjs
import { defineConfig } from 'astro/config';
import viewTransitions from '@astrojs/view-transitions';

export default defineConfig({
	integrations: [viewTransitions()]
});</code></pre>
				
				<h2>Adding Transitions to Links</h2>
				
				<p>Simply add the transition:name attribute to elements you want to animate:</p>
				
				<pre><code><a transition:name="logo" href="/">
	<img src="/logo.svg" alt="Logo" />
</a></code></pre>
				
				<h2>Creating Custom Transitions</h2>
				
				<p>You can customize transitions with CSS:</p>
				
				<pre><code>::view-transition-old(logo),
::view-transition-new(logo) {
	animation-duration: 0.5s;
}</code></pre>
