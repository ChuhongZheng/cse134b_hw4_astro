	<h1>About This Site</h1>
	
	<p>This blog is built with Astro, a modern static site generator that delivers lightning-fast performance with a JavaScript-first approach.</p>
	
	<h2>Why Astro?</h2>
	
	<p>Astro represents a new way of thinking about web development. Rather than shipping a whole page of JavaScript to the client, Astro only sends the parts that are absolutely necessary. This approach results in significantly faster loading times and better user experience.</p>
	
	<h2>Key Features Demonstrated</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li><strong>Component-Based Architecture:</strong> Reusable components like BlogPost and FullBlogPost</li>
		<li><strong>Shared Layouts:</strong> Consistent design across all pages with BlogLayout</li>
		<li><strong>Dynamic Routing:</strong> Individual blog post pages generated from slugs</li>
		<li><strong>Static Site Generation:</strong> Pre-rendered pages for maximum performance</li>
		<li><strong>Zero Client JavaScript:</strong> Fast loading with minimal JavaScript overhead</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Technology Stack</h2>
	
	<ul>
		<li>Astro v5.x - Static site generator</li>
		<li>Vanilla CSS - For styling</li>
		<li>Markdown - For content creation</li>
